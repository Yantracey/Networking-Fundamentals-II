# Networking-Fundamentals-II

In a Network Far, Far Away!

As a Network Jedi working for the Resistance, I successfully completed the mission to restore the Resistance's core DNS infrastructure and verify the routing of traffic. The Sith Empire's DoS attack targeted the Resistance's core network, including DNS servers, crippling communication channels and leaving vulnerable outposts without support.

### Mission 1:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Reviewed the Dark Side PCAP and Galaxy Network Map.
- Deployed a new DNS server and mail server for the Resistance.
- Configured primary mail server asltx.1.google.com and secondary server asltx.2.google.com.
- Identified and documented mail servers for starwars.com using nslookup.
- Explained the Resistance's inability to receive emails.
- Documented suggested DNS corrections.

### Mission 2:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Determined and documented SPF for theforce.net using nslookup.
- Explained why the Force's emails were going to spam.
- Documented suggested DNS corrections.

### Mission 3:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Examined CNAME of www.theforce.net using nslookup.
- Explained why the subpage resistance.theforce.net wasn't redirecting to theforce.net.
- Documented suggested DNS corrections.

### Mission 4:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Confirmed DNS records for princessleia.site.
- Documented how to fix DNS records to prevent future issues.

### Mission 5:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Viewed the Galaxy Network Map.
- Determined the OSPF shortest path from Batuu to Jedha.
- Confirmed that the path didn't include Planet N.
- Documented the shortest path for the Resistance to develop a static route.

### Mission 6:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Used Aircrack-ng to figure out the Dark Side's secret wireless key.
- Decrypted the wireless traffic in Wireshark.
- Identified host IP addresses and MAC addresses from decrypted ARP traffic.
- Documented IP and MAC addresses for Resistance's retaliatory attack.

### Mission 7:

**Completed Tasks:**
- Viewed DNS record from Mission 4.
- Extracted the hidden message in the TXT record.
- Followed the steps included in the message.
- Took a screenshot of the results.

The Galaxy is now secure, and the Resistance is grateful for the successful completion of these missions. May the Force continue to guide and protect us!
